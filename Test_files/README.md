# binance

add your api key and secret key into a file named credentials.json - use the following format  
{'API_KEY': 'paste_here_inside_quotes', 'SECRET_KEY': 'paste_here_inside_quotes'}  

run test.py to check if your connection works  
on mac: python3 test.py  
pc: python test.py  
check the link at the top of test.py for a bit more help  


make sure terminal/cmd prompt/powershell is in the binance folder first, or you need to add the file path before test.py  
in both shells:
- cd folder_name - change directory
  - so if you were in a home directory and you saved this repo to Documents/binance
  - cd Documents/binance
  - OR
  - python Documents/binance/test.py
- cd .. - back up one level
   - yes it's two dots
   - one dot is the current directory, so cd . effectively does nothing

don't worry about the others for now
